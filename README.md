# Welcome to OpenSUTD!

OpenSUTD is:

* a way for people to spawn decentralised initiatives
* an organic movement in school to embrace open sharing and collaboration
* a place for free and open knowledge sharing within and outside of the SUTD Community

OpenSUTD is not a fifth-row style organisation where there is the notion of a member vs non-member. The only thing we recognise is contributions, and anyone can contribute. Contribution is not limited to code. 

OpenSUTD modelled after the idea of an **Open Organisation**, and we have [community standards](https://github.com/OpenSUTD/community) for all members to abide by in order to ensure a good enviroment for members to learn and contribute effectively.

For an living document describing how OpenSUTD developed to where it is today, take a look [here](https://hackmd.io/J4GmoWKrSA62X93c32s-tQ?view).
